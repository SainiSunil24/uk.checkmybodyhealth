Granulated sugar is often used in the home as a sweetener in beverages such as coffee or tea, or on cereals or as an ingredient in baking or cooking. It is used extensively in the production of processed food and drink as a sweetener and a preservative; fizzy drinks, cordial, sweets, chocolate, bread, baked goods, cereal, muesli, granola, flavored yogurt, flavored milk, low-fat products, sauces, salad dressing, soups and processed meals.<\/p><p>Cutting sugar out of the daily diet has been greatly facilitated by the many products in grocery stores and online, which are sugar-free. There are also many products now, which are made using ‘natural’ sweeteners like dates, stevia, coconut sugar, honey or maple syrup. Of the ‘natural’ sweeteners, stevia is the one, which is suitable for diabetics and those on a ketogenic diet. The easiest way to cut sugar from the daily diet is to eat a whole food diet, which contains no processed or pre-packaged food.<\/p>","text_size":"regular"}}},"block_order":["title_8Heg3L","text_kUHGY4"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/magnific-Vn1dpdDH1elJcyd3C22w-derfregnoht_Closely_captured_image_of_someone_holding_an_ice-_5ddfeb96-b8f8-4a60-8ea4-32c35f22dbbb_2.jpg","image_position":"left","image_title":"","image_button_link":"","image_button_title":"","make_add_to_cart_button":false,"image_border":false,"height":"none","is_fullwidth":false,"is_noBorders":true,"image_crop":true,"text_alignment":"horizontal-left","spacing":24,"color_background_main":"#ffffff","color_text_main":"rgba(0,0,0,0)","border_radius":20,"gutter_decrease":false,"remove_margin":false,"remove_bottom_margin":true}},"cmbh_rich_text_bACyEX":{"type":"cmbh-rich-text","blocks":{"title_jX9ndV":{"type":"title","settings":{"title":"Nutrition","title_size":"heading-size--small","seo_h_tag":"h4"}},"text_YBWUJf":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Table sugar, as a carbohydrate, is just sugars and beyond this does not provide any other nutrition.
