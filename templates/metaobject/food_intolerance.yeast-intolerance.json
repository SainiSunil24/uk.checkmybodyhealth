The yeast feeds on this sugar and produces carbon dioxide. It is the carbon dioxide, which makes bread and cakes rise. It is possible to substitute baking soda and an acid in order to produce carbon dioxide and create this rise effect, though your baking may not rise quite as much or you may notice a difference in flavor or texture. You can use lemon juice, buttermilk or a mixture of milk and vinegar as your acid component.<\/p><p>Add equal parts baking soda and lemon juice to equal the amount of yeast required in the recipe. For example use 1 tsp. of baking soda and 1 tsp. of lemon juice if 1 tbsp. of yeast is required. The same applies if using buttermilk or a 50-50 mixture of milk and vinegar.
