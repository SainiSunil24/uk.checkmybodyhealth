If you have a wheat intolerance, you’ll only experience symptoms after eating wheat. If you have a gluten intolerance, you’ll not only experience symptoms after eating wheat, but all other cereals and grains that contain gluten as well. <\/p><p>For more information read our article on the difference between a <a href=\"\/blogs\/intolerances-allergies\/what-is-the-difference-between-wheat-and-gluten-intolerance\" title=\"What is the difference between wheat and gluten intolerance?\">wheat intolerance and gluten intolerance<\/a>.<\/p><h4>What’s the difference between wheat intolerance and coeliac disease?<\/h4><p>Coeliac disease is when your body’s immune system attacks healthy cells every time you eat gluten, which can cause damage to the lining of your gut which can lead to problems with digestion. This can have a major impact on your long-term health, unlike with an intolerance, which only causes short-term effects.<\/p><h4>Wheat intolerance vs wheat allergy<\/h4><p>A wheat allergy is caused by your body’s immune system incorrectly interpreting wheat as a threat, triggering it to attempt to fight it. This is what causes the symptoms, which are often similar to that of a cold or flu.<\/p><p>A wheat intolerance is caused by the body’s inability to process it. The symptoms can be similar to an allergy, but often centre around the gut or stomach.<\/p><h4>How common is wheat intolerance?<\/h4><p>Wheat intolerance is fairly common, which is one of the reasons why there are so many alternatives to wheat-containing products on the market.<\/p><p>Many very young children have a wheat sensitivity or allergy due to their developing digestive and immune systems, but the majority will grow out of it as they enter their teens.<\/p><p>Because wheat is a member of the Poaceae family, it’s common for adults with a wheat allergy or intolerance to also have an allergy to other species in the family, including grass pollen.
