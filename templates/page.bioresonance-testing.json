It is a non-invasive alternative therapeutic technique. Designed on the premise that all particles of matter generate electromagnetic energy. In humans and other animals, this electromagnetic energy continually resonates from the body in oscillations of varying wavelengths and frequencies. This can be detected, amplified, graphed, and examined.<\/p><p>Since its emergence, Bioresonance techniques have been used globally to diagnose disease and to promote healing.

Particularly among children. In fact, the electrodes used to collect information may be attached to the outside of light clothing. Rather than applied directly to the skin.
